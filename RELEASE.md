# How to tag a release for the axelist repo

The tagged release are generated by CircleCI anytime a commit is tagged as
"vX.Y.Z". CircleCI will deploy the release to Artifactory.

1. Determine the version number we want to release. This should follow semver
   semantics after v1.0.0. This version will be referred to as X.Y.Z in the
   remainder of the document.
1. We want to make sure the CHANGELOG.md is up to date
   - Update the module version number for the repo using
     ```
     poetry version X.Y.Z
     ```
   - Create a PR that fixes any errors in the change log
   - In the PR, update the version number. Change "Unreleased" to "X.Y.Z" and
     add a new "Unreleased" section. Be sure to update the hyperlinks found
     at the bottom of the markdown file.
   - Merge the PR.
1. Once merged, we will tag `main` with the version number.

   **_DO NOT forget the "v"._**

   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
